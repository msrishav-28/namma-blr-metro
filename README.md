## Features

- Search Delhi Metro origin and destination stations.
- View route fare, stop count, estimated travel time, interchanges, and line direction.
- Follow the metro on the SVG map with smooth or station-by-station animation.
- Choose route camera zoom levels for map playback and video export.
- Export the journey timeline as PNG.
- Export the animated metro route as MP4 using Mediabunny.

## How Routing Works

Routing is implemented in `src/utils/routePlanner.ts` as a weighted graph over station IDs.

- `src/data/stations-lite.json` provides station IDs, names, and coordinates.
- `src/data/edge.json` provides the metro links between stations, line colors, and SVG path fragments used to draw each segment.
- Each station is added as a graph node.
- Each edge is weighted by the haversine distance between station coordinates. If coordinates are missing or invalid, the edge falls back to `1`.
- Airport Express edges use a reduced routing weight so the faster express line can compete correctly with regular-distance routes.
- Rapid Metro loop links are selectively directed where the service pattern needs one-way traversal.
- `buildRoutes(from, to, language, limit)` returns up to three route options. The first option is the shortest weighted path; alternate options are explored from a distance-sorted queue and capped to keep search responsive.
- Route options are enriched with display names, stops, interchanges, distance, fare, holiday fare, fare type, time limit, estimated journey minutes, and one combined SVG path.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Station search selects from/to IDs] --> B[buildRoutes]
  B --> C[WeightedGraph]
  D[stations-lite.json] --> C
  E[edge.json] --> C
  C --> F[Find shortest route options]
  F --> G[Build RouteSummary]
  G --> H[Detect interchanges from line-color changes]
  G --> I[Calculate distance, fare, time, limits]
  F --> J[Join edge SVG path fragments]
  J --> K[RoutePlan: svgPath + route metadata]
  K --> L[Zustand path store]
  L --> M[Map, timeline, route cards, share panel]
```

The fare calculation follows two paths:

- Regular routes use distance slabs in `estimateFare()`, with a lower holiday fare.
- Airport Express routes split Airport Line fare from regular distance fare, using the explicit `AIRPORT_LINE_FARES` table for express-only segments.

Route sorting in the UI is separate from path finding. The planner can sort returned options by lowest interchange count first, or by lowest stop count first.

## Animation with GSAP

The animated route is rendered in `src/components/graphsvg.tsx`. The route planner returns a single SVG `d` string, and the map uses that path as the rail for both the visible route highlight and the animated train.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as Search / Route option
  participant Store as Zustand stores
  participant Map as graphsvg.tsx
  participant GSAP as GSAP timeline
  participant SVG as SVG path API

  UI->>Store: setRoute(svgPath, route)
  Store->>Map: path, routeStationIds, play, animationMode
  Map->>SVG: create path measure and getTotalLength()
  Map->>SVG: find station progress points along path
  Map->>GSAP: animate proxy.progress
  GSAP->>Map: onUpdate(progress)
  Map->>SVG: getPointAtLength(progress * length)
  Map->>Map: translate/rotate train and move camera
  GSAP->>Store: onComplete setPlay(false)
```

The train is not animated by directly tweening SVG transforms. GSAP animates a small proxy object:

```ts
const proxy = { progress: 0 };
```

On each GSAP update, the current progress is converted into a real SVG point with `getPointAtLength()`. The next point on the path is sampled to compute the train's rotation angle, then the train group receives a `translate(...) rotate(...)` transform. The same progress value drives the camera transform, keeping the train centered during cinematic playback.

There are two route playback modes:

- Smooth mode animates continuously from the first route stop to the last stop with a `power1.inOut` ease.
- Step mode creates one timeline segment per station pair, uses `power2.inOut`, updates the active station at each stop, and adds a short dwell between stations.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Route SVG path] --> B[Hidden measure path]
  B --> C[getTotalLength]
  C --> D[Station progress lookup]
  D --> E{Animation mode}
  E -->|smooth| F[One GSAP tween: first stop to last stop]
  E -->|step| G[GSAP timeline: segment, active station, dwell]
  F --> H[setCameraForProgress]
  G --> H
  H --> I[getPointAtLength]
  I --> J[Train translate + rotate]
  I --> K[Camera scale + translate]
```

Video export reuses the same route math. Instead of depending on live GSAP playback, export code calculates the expected progress for each frame, renders the SVG into a canvas, and writes the frames with Mediabunny.

## Android App

The Android app is published on Google Play as a Trusted Web Activity (TWA):

- Package ID: `in.coolhead.metroroute`
- Play Store: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.coolhead.metroroute&hl=en_IN>
- Production host: `metro.coolhead.in`
- Start URL: `/`

## Android Packaging with Bubblewrap

This repository includes the Bubblewrap-generated Android wrapper for the web app. Bubblewrap reads `twa-manifest.json` and creates the native Android project that launches `https://metro.coolhead.in/` as a Trusted Web Activity.

The important files are:

- `twa-manifest.json`: TWA configuration, package ID, host, icons, theme colors, version codes, and signing key metadata.
- `app/`: generated Android app module.
- `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradle/`, `gradlew`: Android build files generated/used by Bubblewrap and Gradle.
- `app-release-bundle.aab` and signed APK artifacts: release outputs generated from the Android project.

Typical Bubblewrap flow:

```bash
npx @bubblewrap/cli init --manifest https://metro.coolhead.in/manifest.json
npx @bubblewrap/cli update
npx @bubblewrap/cli build
```

Use `npx @bubblewrap/cli update` after changing the web manifest, app metadata, icons, theme colors, Android version codes, or other TWA settings. Build and publish the generated `.aab` through the Google Play Console.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please keep changes focused and easy to review.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
3. Run the app locally with `pnpm run dev`.
4. Make your change using the existing React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand patterns.
5. Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` before opening a pull request.
6. Include a clear PR description with the problem, solution, screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes, and any known limitations.

For data updates, prefer the existing scripts in `scripts/` over manual edits when possible. For Android changes, update `twa-manifest.json` first, then regenerate the Bubblewrap project so the native wrapper stays aligned with the deployed web app.
